If you are using Windows 10 or 11, you may not need to download the driver, as the device uses a Realtek RTL8188RE chipset that has generic drivers in new OS's. However, if you encounter any problems with the device, you can still try installing the driver manually.

3. Find your device under "Network adapters" and right-click on it. Select "Update driver".
4. Choose "Browse my computer for driver software" and then "Let me pick from a list of available drivers on my computer".
5. Select "Realtek RTL8188RE Wireless LAN 802.11n PCI-E NIC" from the list and click "Next".
6. Wait for the driver to install and then click "Close".

## Step 3: Connect to a Wireless Network
 
After installing the driver, you can now connect to a wireless network using your Encore N150 Mini USB Adapter. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Click on the network icon on your taskbar and select "Show available networks".
