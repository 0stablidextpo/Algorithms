One of the most important aspects of Shotokan Karate is the proper execution of stances (tachikata). Stances are the foundation of every technique, as they provide balance, stability, mobility, and power. There are many different stances in Shotokan Karate, each with its own purpose and application. Some of the most common stances are:
  
- Front Stance (Zenkutsu Dachi): A long and low stance that is used for forward attacks and defense. The front leg is bent at 90 degrees, while the back leg is straight. The front foot points forward, while the back foot points slightly outward. The body weight is distributed 60% on the front leg and 40% on the back leg.
- Back Stance (Kokutsu Dachi): A short and high stance that is used for backward movements and defense. The back leg is bent at 90 degrees, while the front leg is slightly bent. The back foot points forward, while the front foot points outward at 90 degrees. The body weight is distributed 70% on the back leg and 30% on the front leg.
- Horse Stance (Kiba Dachi): A wide and low stance that is used for lateral movements and defense. Both legs are bent at 90 degrees, with the feet pointing slightly outward. The body weight is distributed evenly on both legs.
- Cat Stance (Neko Ashi Dachi): A narrow and high stance that is used for quick transitions and attacks. The back leg is straight, while the front leg is slightly bent. The back foot points forward, while the front foot points outward at 45 degrees. The body weight is distributed 90% on the back leg and 10% on the front leg.
